## Design principles

1. All of the events are emitted by kevents.js. It is responsible to start the server or throw any exception

### Client

Client should have the following properties while registering
 - salt question - Secret question . Answer is part of the salt. Not a passphrase (required input. store in clear text)
 - client_id - A v4 uuid (generated by system) (unique key)
 - created time - generated by system
 - publishable - Array of topics that the client can publish
 - subscribable - Array of topics that the client can subscribe to (Not implemented yet)
 - pass - A password hash

Entry to the client database happens through admin console.
Client record in the database looks like the following:


    {
        client_id : 'string',   //v4 uuid
        create_time : 'Date',   //UTC Date time
        salt_question : 'string' //What is your favorite honeymoon place? (Answer is not stored)
        pass : 'string' //pbkdf2 hashed version of the password generated through password gen utility
        publishable: 'array' //['topic1', 'topic2']
        subscribable: 'array' //['topic1', 'topic2']

    }


Eg: 
mqtt pub -h localhost -p 8443 -i mani -u mani -P pass -t hola -m amigos -C mqtts --insecure
